# KnighgtsMove

In this assignment i have tried to implement a greedy algorithm that does not, try to complete the knight tour, but instead tries a ceartain pattern for all squares and sees if that solves it.
The way i run this program is using a Makefile that runs  partly on a linux and partly on a windows machine.
"make main" for compiling the code and after "make go" for running it. the "make clean" only works on windows
For trying a different size board you change the definition in the knight_tour.h file
